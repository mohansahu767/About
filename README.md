### 👋 Hi there, I'm **Mohan Sahu**!

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student passionate about turning ideas into impactful digital solutions.

🚀 Currently diving deep into **Python**, **PHP**, and **Web Development** — building full-stack applications that solve real-world problems.

💡 I love exploring new technologies, optimizing code, and crafting clean, user-focused interfaces. Whether it's an e-learning platform or a healthcare web app, I enjoy creating meaningful projects that make a difference.

🤝 I'm open to collaborating on **open source**, academic, or community-driven tech projects — especially in areas like education, healthcare, or automation.
